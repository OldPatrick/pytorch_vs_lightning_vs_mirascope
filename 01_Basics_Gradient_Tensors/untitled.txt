how dl works

guess a solution
compute the error and show if it was off or not, and if it was off, how much
but the third point is the hardest learn from mistakes and guess a better solution
need a way to describe the mathematical error landscape

derivative for one dimension problems

for multi dimensional ppl tend to call it gradient but its the same as I pointed out already
